help me

to create buzzles:
1. copy template.html and rename it to the title of the buzzle. make sure that there are no spaces in the file name.
2. edit the file.html with the buzzle.
3. once done, encrypt the answer by doing: digestMessage("thedyl1"+answer)
4. add the buzzle to ans.json with the buzzle's file name, title, and solution. the file name is the exact name of the file, without the .html. the title will be displayed in the main buzzles page.
