		<h2>so it seems like you need help. what exactly do you need help with?</h2>
		<p class="question">How do I check if I'm correct?</p>
		<p>the answer checker for each buzzle automatically strips non-alphanumeric characters and runs a check for you. if it's correct it'll validate it and should unlock the next buzzle for you when you return to the main buzzles page. however, the site will NOT display the correct answer (because otherwise you can just view the code before solving the buzzle, see: Why is everything client side. however, the answer checker will display your correct answer until you leave the page.). ensure you have the answer saved somewhere else before you move on.</p>
		<p class="question">I solved a puzzle before but now it says it's unsolved!</p>
		<p>the buzzles page checks your cookies to see if the buzzle has been solved. if the buzzle becomes unsolved, either the cookies expired or your browser doesn't save the cookies. try going into the buzzle page and entering the correct answer again.</p>
		<p class="question">I'm stuck on a puzzle!</p>
		<p>probably not your fault, the buzzle likely sucks. if it is your fault, contact me.</p>
		<p class="question">I'm stuck on this website it sucks</p>
		<p>yea i know im sorry i threw together this website in like 1 day and i know it's bad. if you encounter any game-breaking or earth-shattering or ball-busting bugs in the website please let me know.</p>
		<p class="question">Why is everything (e.g. answer-checker) client side?</p>
		<p>yea cos im noob at computer science and github pages only allows static sites (html css and js only). whatever go ahead and read the js to cheat or sth but where's the fun in that. most likely i have encrypted all answers and getting the code isn't going to help you anyway.</p>
		<p class="question">How can I contact you?</p>
		<p><a href="mailto:thedylone@gmail.com">thedylone@gmail.com</a></p>
		<p class="question">Is there a hidden puzzle on this page?</p>
		<p>maybe ðŸ¤”</p>
