			<p>You look up, and are greeted by the sight of your Sakuya fumo, animated by some otherworldly power. “Welcome to Gensokyo, fumo,” Sakuya greets you with a smile.</p>
			<p>Wait, what?! Did she just say fumo? You look down, and to your horror, you realise you’re trapped in the fluffy squishy body of a fumo yourself! “What’s going on here?”</p>
			<p>“Gensokyo’s recently been going through a pretty bad crisis,” explains Sakuya. “So an incident has happened and our world has forgotten a particular word that you need to figure out… you know what, I’m too lazy to explain the story, you play the game anyway. Come find me when you’ve got it.”</p>
			<p>Well, that didn’t exactly help, and you decide to go looking around for more clues. But as you begin to explore your surroundings, you get the feeling that you’re not the only thing from your world that was sent here…</p>
